## Quick Start (Docker)

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Docker installed on your host (Linux, macOS, Windows or Raspberry Pi).  (Current Images Built for Linux x86 & ARM64 Raspberry Pi)
   - Docker support is currently untested on Windows & MacOS, and the Raspberry Pi image remains fresh and untested - please report back!
   - A Meshtastic device connected via USB or WiFi (No Bluetooth testing Done as of yet)
   - If needed,uncomment USB sections and set identifiers such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `\\.\COM3`.

2. **Prepare the Volume Structure**  
   - In the root of your project directory:
   - Extract the "docker-required-volumes.zip" - The included "config" & "logs" folders should be within your "mesh-ai folder"
   - This file structure differs from the standard release to accommodate volumes for docker
   - These files are placed in order to prevent docker from replacing these with directories on first start and throwing errors.
   - Make any changes to config files as needed before moving forward.

File structure should look like this:

   ```bash
   mesh-ai/
   ├── config/
   │   ├── config.json
   │   ├── commands_config.json
   │   └── motd.json
   └── logs/
    ├── script.log
    ├── messages.log
    └── messages_archive.json
```


3. **Pull & run the Docker Image using docker-compose**
   - An example docker-compose-yaml is included in the github repository - please adjust as needed.
   - From the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker pull mrtbot/mesh-ai:latest
   docker-compose up -d
  

4. **Access the WebUI Dashboard:**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard).

## Basic Usage

- **Interacting with the AI:**  
  - Use `/ai` (or `/bot`, `/query`, `/data`) followed by your message to receive an AI response.
  - For direct messages, simply DM the AI node if configured to reply.
- **Location Query:**  
  - Send `/whereami` to retrieve the node’s GPS coordinates (if available).
- **Emergency Alerts:**  
  - Trigger an emergency using `/emergency <message>` or `/911 <message>`.  
    - These commands send alerts via Twilio, SMTP, and Discord (if enabled), including GPS data and timestamps.
- **Sending and receiving SMS:**  
  - Send SMS using `/sms <+15555555555> <message>`
  - Config options to either route incoming Twilio SMS messages to a specific node, or a channel index.
- **Home Assistant Integration:**  
  - When enabled, messages sent on the designated Home Assistant channel (as defined by `"home_assistant_channel_index"`) are forwarded to Home Assistant’s conversation API.
  - In secure mode, include the PIN in your message (format: `PIN=XXXX your message`).
- **WebUI Messaging:**  
  - Use the dashboard’s send‑message form to send broadcast or direct messages. The mode toggle and node selection simplify quick replies.

## Health & Monitoring

- Probes (JSON):
  - `GET /ready` → 200 only when the radio is connected; 503 otherwise.
  - `GET /live` → liveness check (always 200 when the app loop is running).
  - `GET /healthz` → detailed status including:
    - `status` (Connected/Disconnected), `queue` size, `worker` and `heartbeat` flags,
    - `rx_age_s`, `tx_age_s`, `ai_age_s`, and `ai_error` (if any) with `ai_error_age_s`.
    - Returns 503 if degraded (radio disconnected, response queue stalled, or recent AI error).

- Examples:
  - `curl http://localhost:5000/ready`
  - `curl http://localhost:5000/live`
  - `curl http://localhost:5000/healthz`

- Heartbeat:
  - A concise heartbeat is logged roughly every 30 seconds showing connection status and activity ages.
  - View with: `tail -f mesh-ai.log`

---

## Upgrade to v1.0

1) Stop any running instance and service (if used)
- `systemctl --user stop mesh-ai.service`

2) Pull latest changes and update dependencies (if needed)
- `git pull`
- `source .venv/bin/activate` (or your venv) and `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) Start via the user service or helper script
- `systemctl --user start mesh-ai.service`
  - or: `NO_BROWSER=1 bash start_mesh_ai.sh`

4) Verify readiness and health
- `curl http://localhost:5000/ready`
- `curl http://localhost:5000/healthz`
- `tail -f mesh-ai.log` (look for periodic heartbeat lines)

Notes
- v1 enforces a single running instance via a lightweight PID lock to avoid serial port conflicts.
- Admin commands (`/changeprompt`, `/changemotd`, `/showprompt`, `/printprompt`) are DM‑only and persist across restarts.

### Discord Integration: Detailed Setup & Permissions

![483177250_1671387500130340_6790017825443843758_n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0042b7a9-8ec9-4492-8668-25ac977a74cd)


#### 1. Create a Discord Bot
- **Access the Developer Portal:**  
  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in with your Discord account.
- **Create a New Application:**  
  Click on "New Application," give it a name (e.g., *MESH-AI Bot*), and confirm.
- **Add a Bot to Your Application:**  
  - Select your application, then navigate to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.  
  - Click on **"Add Bot"** and confirm by clicking **"Yes, do it!"**  
  - Customize your bot’s username and icon if desired.

#### 2. Set Up Bot Permissions
- **Required Permissions:**  
  Your bot needs a few basic permissions to function correctly:
  - **View Channels:** So it can see messages in the designated channels.
  - **Send Messages:** To post responses and emergency alerts.
  - **Read Message History:** For polling messages from a channel (if polling is enabled).
  - **Manage Messages (Optional):** If you want the bot to delete or manage messages.
- **Permission Calculator:**  
  Use a tool like [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) to generate the correct permission integer.  
  For minimal functionality, a permission integer of **3072** (which covers "Send Messages," "View Channels," and "Read Message History") is often sufficient.

#### 3. Invite the Bot to Your Server
- **Generate an Invite Link:**  
  Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot’s client ID (found in the **General Information** tab) in the following URL:
  ```url
  https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3072&scope=bot
  ```
- **Invite the Bot:**  
  Open the link in your browser, select the server where you want to add the bot, and authorize it. Make sure you have the “Manage Server” permission in that server.

#### 4. Configure Bot Credentials in `config.json`
Update your configuration file with the following keys (replace placeholder text with your actual values):
```json
{
  "enable_discord": true,
  "discord_webhook_url": "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL",
  "discord_receive_enabled": true,
  "discord_bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "discord_channel_id": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  "discord_inbound_channel_index": 1,  // or the channel number you prefer
  "discord_send_ai": true,
  "discord_send_emergency": true
}
```
- **discord_webhook_url:**  
  Create a webhook in your desired Discord channel (Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) and copy its URL.
- **discord_bot_token & discord_channel_id:**  
  Copy your bot’s token from the Developer Portal and enable message polling by specifying the channel ID where the bot should read messages.  
  To get a channel ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode) then right-click the channel and select "Copy ID."

#### 5. Polling Integration (Optional)
- **Enable Message Polling:**  
  Set `"discord_receive_enabled": true` to allow the bot to poll for new messages.
- **Routing:**  
  The configuration key `"discord_inbound_channel_index"` determines the channel number used by MESH-AI for routing incoming Discord messages. Make sure it matches your setup.

#### 6. Testing Your Discord Setup
- **Restart MESH-AI:**  
  With the updated configuration, restart your bot.
- **Check Bot Activity:**  
  Verify that the bot is present in your server, that it can see messages in the designated channel, and that it can send responses.  
- **Emergency Alerts & AI Responses:**  
  Confirm that emergency alerts and AI responses are being posted in Discord as per your configuration (`"discord_send_ai": true` and `"discord_send_emergency": true`).

#### 7. Troubleshooting Tips
- **Permissions Issues:**  
  If the bot isn’t responding or reading messages, double-check that its role on your server has the required permissions.
- **Channel IDs & Webhook URLs:**  
  Verify that you’ve copied the correct channel IDs and webhook URLs (ensure no extra spaces or formatting issues).
- **Bot Token Security:**  
  Keep your bot token secure. If it gets compromised, regenerate it immediately from the Developer Portal.

---

### Twilio Integration
- **Enable Twilio:**  
  - Set `"enable_twilio": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure Twilio Credentials:**  
  - Provide your Twilio settings in `config.json`:
    - `"twilio_sid": "YOUR_TWILIO_SID"`
    - `"twilio_auth_token": "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"`
    - `"twilio_from_number": "YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER"`
    - `"alert_phone_number": "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"` (the number to receive emergency SMS)
- **Usage:**  
  - When an emergency is triggered, the bot sends an SMS containing the alert message (with a Google Maps link if GPS data is available).
- **Tip:**  
  - Follow [Twilio's setup guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account) to obtain your SID and Auth Token, and ensure that your phone numbers are verified.

## Other Important Settings

- **Logging & Archives:**  
  - Script logs are stored in `script.log` and message logs in `messages.log`.
  - An archive is maintained in `messages_archive.json` to keep recent messages.
  
- **Device Connection:**  
  - Configure the connection method for your Meshtastic device by setting either the `"serial_port"` or enabling `"use_wifi"` along with `"wifi_host"` and `"wifi_port"`.  
  - Alternatively, enable `"use_mesh_interface"` if applicable.
  - Baud Rate is optionally set if you need - this is for longer USB runs (roof nodes connected via USB) and bad USB connections.
  
- **Message Routing & Commands:**  
  - Custom commands can be added in `commands_config.json`.
  - The WebUI Dashboard (accessible at [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)) displays messages and node status.
  
- **AI Provider Settings:**  
  - Adjust `"ai_provider"` and related API settings (timeouts, models, etc.) for LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama, or Home Assistant integration.
  
- **Security:**  
  - If using Home Assistant with PIN protection, follow the specified format (`PIN=XXXX your message`) to ensure messages are accepted.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - You can test SMS sending with the `/sms` command or trigger an emergency alert to confirm that Twilio and email integrations are functioning.
