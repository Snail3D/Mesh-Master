## 2.5 Headline Upgrades
- **Network Bridge Relay with ACK Tracking** ‚Äî Forward messages to any node by shortname: `snmo hello there` or `/snmo hello there`. Real-time ACK confirmation shows which node acknowledged. Multi-chunk support for long messages. Acts as a bridge across multiple mesh networks‚Äîif this node sees networks A and B, users on network A can relay to users on network B seamlessly. **NEW:** Offline message queue stores failed relays and automatically delivers when recipient comes online (up to 3 attempts, 24-hour expiry).
- **Relay Privacy Controls** ‚Äî `/optout` disables receiving relays (others can't relay to you), `/optin` re-enables. Privacy preferences persist across reboots and updates in `data/relay_optout.json`.
- **Cross-Network Node Discovery** ‚Äî `/nodes` lists all nodes seen in the last 24 hours across all channels/networks (sorted newest first). `/node <shortname>` shows detailed signal info (SNR, signal strength, last heard, hops, battery level, power status) with modem-aware thresholds. `/networks` lists all connected channels.
- **Context-Aware AI Help** ‚Äî `/system <question>` provides AI responses with full system awareness (~50k token context including all commands, architecture, your settings, network state). Auto-activates during onboarding and after `/help` or `/menu` for seamless learning.
- **Interactive Onboarding** ‚Äî New users receive a guided 9-step tour via `/onboard` (or `/onboarding`, `/onboardme`) covering the main menu, mesh mail, logs & reports, games, AI assistance, and helpful tools. Fully customizable welcome messages through the dashboard. Context-aware help available at any step.
- **Private Logs & Public Reports** ‚Äî `/log` creates private entries visible only to you; `/report` creates public entries searchable by everyone via `/find`. **NEW:** Fuzzy matching with "Did you mean" suggestions for misspelled names. Command aliases: `/readlog`, `/readlogs`, `/checklog`, `/checklogs` (logs) and `/readreport`, `/readreports`, `/checkreport`, `/checkreports` (reports).
- **Enhanced Privacy & Security** ‚Äî Message content redacted in all debug/info logs (shows `[X chars]` instead of full text). URL filter blocks adult and warez sites from crawling and search results with humorous error message. All sensitive user data gitignored.
- **Enhanced Dashboard** ‚Äî Real-time activity feed (20-line mobile-optimized view), radio configuration controls (node names, roles, modem presets, frequency slots), Ollama model management, collapsible command categories, and GitHub version selector. Accessible on mobile devices via `http://<your-ip>:5000/dashboard`.
- **Data Persistence** ‚Äî All user data (logs, reports, mail, settings, game states, relay preferences) now protected by `.gitignore` and persists across git updates and system reboots.
- **Mesh Mail** ‚Äî PIN-protected inboxes, multi-user notifications, and one-shot llama summaries keep longer messages flowing across the mesh.
- **Game Hub** ‚Äî Chess & Checkers duels, Blackjack, Yahtzee rounds, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Wordle, Word Ladder, Adventure stories, Cipher drills, Bingo, Morse, Rock‚ÄìPaper‚ÄìScissors, Coinflip, Quiz Battle, **Mesh Master Quiz** (`/masterquiz` - 50 comprehensive questions), **Meshtastic Quiz** (`/meshtasticquiz` - 50 detailed questions), and more‚Äîall DM-friendly and multilingual.
- **Adaptive Personalities & Context Capsules** ‚Äî `/aipersonality` and `/save`/`/recall` tune the assistant instantly while persistent archives keep continuity across restarts.
- **Offline Knowledge on Tap** ‚Äî Trimmed MeshTastic handbook, offline wiki lookups, and cached expert answers deliver verified guidance without leaving the mesh.
- **Simplified Activity Logs** ‚Äî Icon-based notifications (üì® incoming, üìñ Bible, üéÆ Game, ü§ñ AI, etc.) with no message content or node names for privacy and reduced clutter.
- **Hardening for the Field** ‚Äî Automatic orphaned process cleanup, improved serial port lock handling, larger async queues, smarter retry logic, strict single-instance locks, and heartbeat-driven health reporting for container or bare-metal deployments.

## Feature Overview

### Network Bridge Relay System
MESH MASTER 2.5 can act as a relay bridge between multiple mesh networks, enabling communication across network boundaries.

**How It Works:**
- Send messages to any node by shortname: `snmo hello there` or `/snmo hello there`
- Real-time ACK tracking with 20-second timeout
- Confirmation shows which node acknowledged: `‚úÖ ACK by NodeName` or `‚ùå No ACK from NodeName`
- Multi-chunk support automatically handles long messages (tracks ACKs for all chunks)
- Queue-based architecture handles relay bursts safely (3 concurrent workers, 100-item queue)
- **Offline message queue:** Failed relays automatically stored and delivered when recipient comes online (max 10 messages per user, 24-hour expiry, 3 delivery attempts)
- **Privacy controls:** `/optout` to disable receiving relays, `/optin` to re-enable (preferences persist in `data/relay_optout.json`)

**Cross-Network Bridge:**
If MESH MASTER is connected to multiple networks (e.g., SnailNet + MainChannel), it acts as a bridge:
- Users on SnailNet can relay to users on MainChannel and vice versa
- `/nodes` command shows all reachable nodes across all networks
- Seamless multi-network communication without manual routing

**Example Use Case:**
```
Network A: Alice, Bob, MESH-MASTER
Network B: Charlie, MESH-MASTER

Alice (on Network A): "charlie how's the weather?"
MESH-MASTER relays across network boundary
Charlie receives message, ACKs back
Alice gets: "‚úÖ ACK by Charlie"
```

### Context-Aware AI Help System
MESH MASTER 2.5 includes an intelligent help system that provides AI responses with full awareness of your system configuration, available commands, and network state.

**Features:**
- **`/system <question>`** ‚Äî Ask questions with ~50k token context including all commands, architecture details, your current settings, and network status
- **Auto-activation:** System context automatically activates during onboarding and after `/help` or `/menu` commands
- **Single-use mode:** After help commands, the next AI question gets full system context, then clears to avoid overhead
- **Persistent mode:** During onboarding, context remains active for the entire session (30-minute timeout)
- **Frustration detection:** AI can gently suggest `/reset` to clear conversation memory when you seem stuck

**Example queries:**
- `/system how does the relay work?` ‚Äî Get detailed explanation of relay system with ACK tracking
- `/system what LLM am I using?` ‚Äî See your current model and provider configuration
- `/system how do I search my logs?` ‚Äî Learn about `/checklog`, `/readlog`, and `/find` commands

### Persistent Mesh Intelligence
- End-to-end message history survives restarts (`messages_archive.json`) with configurable limits.
- Background async workers keep RX/TX responsive while Ollama generates replies.
- Tone and personalities can be adjusted at runtime with `/vibe`; the core system prompt is fixed. MOTD can be updated via DM-only admin commands.

### Mesh Mail & Collaboration
- Direct-message `/m mailbox message` to drop mail; guided flow creates boxes, sets optional PINs, and captures owner metadata.  
- `/c mailbox [question]` shows the latest entries and, when a question is provided, uses the bundled `llama3.2:1b` model to pull a concise answer.  
- `/wipe mailbox`, `/wipe chathistory`, `/wipe personality`, and `/wipe all <mailbox>` keep things tidy.  
- Notification engine flags subscribers on heartbeat with unread counts while respecting PIN security and brute-force throttling.  
- See `docs/mail_readme.md` for deep-dive internals.

### Game Hub & Morale Tools
- `/games` lists every title with quick descriptions and command hints.
- Story-driven `/adventure` adapts to the chat language and offers branching outcomes.
- `/wordladder` teammates can collaboratively bridge start/end words, asking the llama for hints on demand.
- Manage risk in `/blackjack`, push streaks in `/yahtzee`, or rally the squad with `/games` for the full list.
- Fast laughs with `/rps`, `/coinflip`, and `/quizbattle`; puzzle practice with `/cipher`, `/morse`, `/hangman`, `/wordle`.
- **Comprehensive Quiz Games:**
  - `/masterquiz` ‚Äî 50 questions covering all Mesh Master features (relay, logs, reports, commands, mail, offline queue, dashboard, wiki, games)
  - `/meshtasticquiz` ‚Äî 50 questions about Meshtastic (LoRa, mesh networking, node roles, SNR, presets, security, best practices)
  - Answer with 1-4 or a-d, check score anytime, auto-shuffled questions for replay value

### Knowledge & Research Aids
- `/meshtastic <question>` consults a curated ~25k token field guide with a warm cache for instant follow-ups.
- `/offline wiki <topic>` or `/offline wiki <topic> PIN=1234` taps locally mirrored reference articles.
- `/save` captures conversation context capsules for later `/recall`‚Äîperfect for mission hand-offs.
- `/find <query>` searches across private logs, public reports, wiki entries, and web crawl data with fuzzy matching.
- **URL Content Filter:** `/web` commands automatically block adult and warez sites from crawling and search results.
- **Fuzzy Search:** When log/report names are misspelled, get "Did you mean?" suggestions with top 3 matches.

### Web Dashboard & APIs
- Real-time log viewer with emoji categories (üì° connection, üì® messages, ü§ñ AI, ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings, üîß admin).  
- Three-column mesh console surfaces broadcasts, direct messages, and nearby nodes; quick-send form handles DM routing and chunking.  
- Health endpoints: `GET /ready`, `/live`, `/healthz`, `/heartbeat`, plus `/dashboard` and `/logs` frontends.  
- `/send` and `/ui_send` POST endpoints enable automated workflows; optional `/discord_webhook` bridge for cross-platform relays.

### Integrations & Extensibility
- Native Ollama support tuned for low-bandwidth meshes (`llama3.2:1b` by default) with adjustable context size, chunk delays, and timeout controls.  
- Home Assistant relay can forward a dedicated channel (with optional PIN requirement) to the Conversation API.  
- Feature flags (`feature_flags.json`) let operators disable specific commands or restrict replies to DMs/broadcasts.

## Container Workflow

Build the 2.5 image locally so you run the exact code in this repository:

```bash
docker build -t mesh-master:2.5 .
```

Minimal compose example:

```yaml
services:
  mesh-master:
    image: mesh-master:2.5
    container_name: mesh-master
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
      - ./commands_config.json:/app/commands_config.json:ro
      - ./motd.json:/app/motd.json:ro
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./state/mesh-master.log:/app/mesh-master.log
      - ./state/messages.log:/app/messages.log
      - ./state/messages_archive.json:/app/messages_archive.json
      - ./state/script.log:/app/script.log
      - ./state/mesh_mailboxes.json:/app/mesh_mailboxes.json
      - ./state/mesh_mail.db:/app/mesh_mail.db
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If you rely on USB serial, also bind `/dev/serial/by-id` (read-only) and `/dev` as needed, and set `MESH_INTERFACE`/`serial_port` accordingly.

Create the `state` directory (and `touch` the files listed above) before the first run so Docker can mount them successfully.

## Hardware Tips

- **RAK4631 Always-On Profile:**
  1. Copy `99-rak-no-autosuspend.rules` into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, reload udev, and replug the device.  
  2. Apply `hardware_profiles/rak4631_always_on.yaml` with `./scripts/apply_rak4631_profile.py` (add `--dry-run` to preview).  
  3. Confirm `role: ROUTER_CLIENT` and `is_power_saving: false` with `meshtastic --info`.
- **Log Hygiene:** `CLEAN_LOGGING.md` outlines how to rotate logs safely when running unattended.  
- **Back up frequently:** snapshot `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, `motd.json`, `messages.log`, `messages_archive.json`, `mesh_mailboxes.json`, and `data/mail_security.json` together.

---

## Upgrade Notes from 1.x

- Single-instance PID locks prevent accidental double starts. Stop older services before launching 2.0.  
- Mesh Mail subsystems replace ad-hoc DM forwarding‚Äîmigrate workflows to `/m`/`/c` commands.  
- New async response queue defaults to 25 messages; adjust `async_response_queue_max` if running on limited hardware.  
- Knowledge base trimmed and cached; tune `meshtastic_kb_max_context_chars` when using larger models.  
- Dashboard styling and APIs remain compatible, but cached assets moved to `static/`.
