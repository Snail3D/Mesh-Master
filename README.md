## 2.0 Headline Upgrades
- **Interactive Onboarding** ‚Äî New users receive a guided 9-step tour via `/onboard` (or `/onboarding`, `/onboardme`) covering the main menu, mesh mail, logs & reports, games, AI assistance, and helpful tools. Fully customizable welcome messages through the dashboard.
- **Private Logs & Public Reports** ‚Äî `/log` creates private entries visible only to you; `/report` creates public entries searchable by everyone via `/find`. Perfect for personal notes vs. team-wide information sharing.
- **Enhanced Dashboard** ‚Äî Real-time activity feed, radio configuration controls (node names, roles, modem presets, frequency slots), Ollama model management, collapsible command categories, and GitHub version selector.
- **Data Persistence** ‚Äî All user data (logs, reports, mail, settings, game states) now protected by `.gitignore` and persists across git updates and system reboots.
- **Mesh Mail** ‚Äî PIN-protected inboxes, multi-user notifications, and one-shot llama summaries keep longer messages flowing across the mesh.
- **Game Hub** ‚Äî Chess & Checkers duels, Blackjack, Yahtzee rounds, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Wordle, Word Ladder, Adventure stories, Cipher drills, Bingo, Morse, Rock‚ÄìPaper‚ÄìScissors, Coinflip, Quiz Battle, and more‚Äîall DM-friendly and multilingual.
- **Adaptive Personalities & Context Capsules** ‚Äî `/aipersonality` and `/save`/`/recall` tune the assistant instantly while persistent archives keep continuity across restarts.
- **Offline Knowledge on Tap** ‚Äî Trimmed MeshTastic handbook, offline wiki lookups, and cached expert answers deliver verified guidance without leaving the mesh.
- **Simplified Activity Logs** ‚Äî Icon-based notifications (üì® incoming, üìñ Bible, üéÆ Game, ü§ñ AI, etc.) with no message content or node names for privacy and reduced clutter.
- **Hardening for the Field** ‚Äî Automatic orphaned process cleanup, improved serial port lock handling, larger async queues, smarter retry logic, strict single-instance locks, and heartbeat-driven health reporting for container or bare-metal deployments.

## Feature Overview

### Persistent Mesh Intelligence
- End-to-end message history survives restarts (`messages_archive.json`) with configurable limits.  
- Background async workers keep RX/TX responsive while Ollama generates replies.  
- Tone and personalities can be adjusted at runtime with `/vibe`; the core system prompt is fixed. MOTD can be updated via DM-only admin commands.

### Mesh Mail & Collaboration
- Direct-message `/m mailbox message` to drop mail; guided flow creates boxes, sets optional PINs, and captures owner metadata.  
- `/c mailbox [question]` shows the latest entries and, when a question is provided, uses the bundled `llama3.2:1b` model to pull a concise answer.  
- `/wipe mailbox`, `/wipe chathistory`, `/wipe personality`, and `/wipe all <mailbox>` keep things tidy.  
- Notification engine flags subscribers on heartbeat with unread counts while respecting PIN security and brute-force throttling.  
- See `docs/mail_readme.md` for deep-dive internals.

### Game Hub & Morale Tools
- `/games` lists every title with quick descriptions and command hints.  
- Story-driven `/adventure` adapts to the chat language and offers branching outcomes.  
- `/wordladder` teammates can collaboratively bridge start/end words, asking the llama for hints on demand.  
- Manage risk in `/blackjack`, push streaks in `/yahtzee`, or rally the squad with `/games` for the full list.  
- Fast laughs with `/rps`, `/coinflip`, and `/quizbattle`; puzzle practice with `/cipher`, `/morse`, `/hangman`, `/wordle`.

### Knowledge & Research Aids
- `/meshtastic <question>` consults a curated ~25k token field guide with a warm cache for instant follow-ups.  
- `/offline wiki <topic>` or `/offline wiki <topic> PIN=1234` taps locally mirrored reference articles.  
- `/save` captures conversation context capsules for later `/recall`‚Äîperfect for mission hand-offs.

### Web Dashboard & APIs
- Real-time log viewer with emoji categories (üì° connection, üì® messages, ü§ñ AI, ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings, üîß admin).  
- Three-column mesh console surfaces broadcasts, direct messages, and nearby nodes; quick-send form handles DM routing and chunking.  
- Health endpoints: `GET /ready`, `/live`, `/healthz`, `/heartbeat`, plus `/dashboard` and `/logs` frontends.  
- `/send` and `/ui_send` POST endpoints enable automated workflows; optional `/discord_webhook` bridge for cross-platform relays.

### Integrations & Extensibility
- Native Ollama support tuned for low-bandwidth meshes (`llama3.2:1b` by default) with adjustable context size, chunk delays, and timeout controls.  
- Home Assistant relay can forward a dedicated channel (with optional PIN requirement) to the Conversation API.  
- Feature flags (`feature_flags.json`) let operators disable specific commands or restrict replies to DMs/broadcasts.

## Container Workflow

Build the 2.0 image locally so you run the exact code in this repository:

```bash
docker build -t mesh-master:2.0 .
```

Minimal compose example:

```yaml
services:
  mesh-master:
    image: mesh-master:2.0
    container_name: mesh-master
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
      - ./commands_config.json:/app/commands_config.json:ro
      - ./motd.json:/app/motd.json:ro
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./state/mesh-master.log:/app/mesh-master.log
      - ./state/messages.log:/app/messages.log
      - ./state/messages_archive.json:/app/messages_archive.json
      - ./state/script.log:/app/script.log
      - ./state/mesh_mailboxes.json:/app/mesh_mailboxes.json
      - ./state/mesh_mail.db:/app/mesh_mail.db
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If you rely on USB serial, also bind `/dev/serial/by-id` (read-only) and `/dev` as needed, and set `MESH_INTERFACE`/`serial_port` accordingly.

Create the `state` directory (and `touch` the files listed above) before the first run so Docker can mount them successfully.

## Dashboard & Monitoring

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` for:

- **Real-time Activity Feed** ‚Äî Icon-based log stream with emoji categorization (üì® incoming, üìñ Bible, üéÆ Game, ü§ñ AI, üîê Admin, etc.). Toggle between summary and verbose modes.
- **Radio Configuration** ‚Äî Set node names (long/short), device role (CLIENT, ROUTER, REPEATER), modem preset (spreading factor), and frequency slot‚Äîall dynamically pulled from current Meshtastic firmware.
- **Ollama Model Management** ‚Äî View installed models, switch active model, download new models with progress tracking.
- **Onboarding Customization** ‚Äî Enable/disable auto-onboarding for new users and customize the welcome message.
- **Operations Center** ‚Äî Browse all available commands organized by category (Admin, AI Settings, Email, Games, Fun, Web & Search, etc.). Categories default to collapsed for a cleaner view.
- **GitHub Version Control** ‚Äî View current branch and available versions, switch branches directly from the dashboard.
- **Configuration Editor** ‚Äî Edit settings by category (Serial Connection, AI, Messaging, etc.) with inline help tooltips.

**Health Monitoring:**
- **Logs:** `/logs` (HTML) and `/logs/raw` (plain text); streaming SSE feed powers the dashboard in real time.
- **Health probes:**
  - `GET /ready` ‚Üí HTTP 200 only when the radio link is up (503 otherwise).
  - `GET /live` ‚Üí process liveness.
  - `GET /healthz` ‚Üí full JSON snapshot (connection, queue depth, worker status, AI timing, last error).
- **Heartbeat:** Watch `mesh-master.log` for the `üíì HB` line every ~30 seconds summarizing RX/TX/AI ages.
- **REST hooks:** `POST /send` and `POST /ui_send` accept JSON payloads for automations; `/discord_webhook` bridges Discord events into the mesh when enabled.

## Onboarding System

New users receive an interactive 9-step guided tour when they send `/onboard`, `/onboarding`, or `/onboardme` via DM:

1. **Welcome** ‚Äî Introduction to MESH-MASTER capabilities
2. **Main Menu** ‚Äî How to access `/menu` for all features
3. **Mesh Mail** ‚Äî Sending and receiving messages with `/mail` and `/checkmail`
4. **Logs & Reports** ‚Äî Private logs (visible only to you) vs. public reports (searchable by all)

## Configuration Essentials

Key fields from `config.json` (trimmed for brevity):

```json
{
  "serial_port": "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-RAKwireless_WisCore_RAK4631_Board_XXXX",
  "serial_baud": 38400,
  "ai_provider": "ollama",
  "system_prompt": "You are an offline chatbot serving a local mesh network...",
  "ollama_model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "ollama_timeout": 120,
  "ollama_context_chars": 4000,
  "async_response_queue_max": 25,
  "meshtastic_kb_max_context_chars": 3200,
  "meshtastic_kb_cache_ttl": 600,
  "default_personality_id": "trail_scout",
  "mail_search_timeout": 120,
  "reply_in_channels": true,
  "reply_in_directs": true,
  "chunk_size": 200,
  "chunk_buffer_seconds": 1,
  "home_assistant_enabled": false,
  "home_assistant_channel_index": 1
}
```

Additional knobs:
- **Mesh Mail:** `mailbox_max_messages`, `mail_follow_up_delay`, `mail_notify_enabled`, `mail_notify_reminders_enabled`, `mail_notify_quiet_hours_enabled`, `mail_notify_reminder_hours`, `mail_notify_expiry_hours`, `mail_notify_max_reminders`, `mail_notify_include_self`, `mail_notify_heartbeat_only`, `mail_search_model`, `mail_search_max_messages`, `mail_search_num_ctx`, `mail_search_timeout`, `notify_active_start_hour`, `notify_active_end_hour`, and `mail_security_file`.
- **Saved context:** `saved_context_max_chars`, `saved_context_summary_chars`, `context_session_timeout_seconds`.
- **Feature toggles:** `feature_flags.json` can disable commands or switch `message_mode` to `broadcast`, `dm`, or `both`.
- **Logs & Reports:** `logs_dir` (default: `data/logs`) stores private user logs; `reports_dir` (default: `data/reports`) stores public reports. Configure `logs_max_entries` and `reports_max_entries` to limit storage.
- **Offline knowledge:** configure `offline_wiki_dir`, `offline_crawl_dir`, `offline_ddg_dir` plus the `*_summary_chars` / `*_context_chars` settings to control local article size. Use `/find <query>` in a DM to search wiki snapshots, crawls, DDG saves, reports (public), and logs (your private entries only)‚Äîreply with the number to open or return the entry.

Remember to restart the service after editing configs that lack runtime setters.

## Hardware Tips

- **RAK4631 Always-On Profile:**
  1. Copy `99-rak-no-autosuspend.rules` into `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, reload udev, and replug the device.  
  2. Apply `hardware_profiles/rak4631_always_on.yaml` with `./scripts/apply_rak4631_profile.py` (add `--dry-run` to preview).  
  3. Confirm `role: ROUTER_CLIENT` and `is_power_saving: false` with `meshtastic --info`.
- **Log Hygiene:** `CLEAN_LOGGING.md` outlines how to rotate logs safely when running unattended.  
- **Back up frequently:** snapshot `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, `motd.json`, `messages.log`, `messages_archive.json`, `mesh_mailboxes.json`, and `data/mail_security.json` together.

## Upgrade Notes from 1.x

- Single-instance PID locks prevent accidental double starts. Stop older services before launching 2.0.  
- Mesh Mail subsystems replace ad-hoc DM forwarding‚Äîmigrate workflows to `/m`/`/c` commands.  
- New async response queue defaults to 25 messages; adjust `async_response_queue_max` if running on limited hardware.  
- Knowledge base trimmed and cached; tune `meshtastic_kb_max_context_chars` when using larger models.  
- Dashboard styling and APIs remain compatible, but cached assets moved to `static/`.
