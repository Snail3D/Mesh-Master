## 2.0 Headline Upgrades
- **Network Bridge Relay with ACK Tracking** ‚Äî Forward messages to any node by shortname: `snmo hello there` or `/snmo hello there`. Real-time ACK confirmation shows which node acknowledged. Multi-chunk support for long messages. Acts as a bridge across multiple mesh networks‚Äîif this node sees networks A and B, users on network A can relay to users on network B seamlessly. **NEW:** Offline message queue stores failed relays and automatically delivers when recipient comes online (up to 3 attempts, 24-hour expiry).
- **Relay Privacy Controls** ‚Äî `/optout` disables receiving relays (others can't relay to the user), `/optin` re-enables. Privacy preferences persist across reboots and updates in `data/relay_optout.json`.
- **Cross-Network Node Discovery** ‚Äî `/nodes` lists all nodes seen in the last 24 hours across all channels/networks (sorted newest first). `/node <shortname>` shows detailed signal info (SNR, signal strength, last heard, hops, battery level, power status) with modem-aware thresholds. `/networks` lists all connected channels.
- **Interactive Onboarding** ‚Äî New users receive a guided 9-step tour via `/onboard` (or `/onboarding`, `/onboardme`) covering the main menu, mesh mail, logs & reports, games, AI assistance, and helpful tools. Fully customizable welcome messages through the dashboard.
- **Private Logs & Public Reports** ‚Äî `/log` creates private entries visible only to the author; `/report` creates public entries searchable by everyone via `/find`. **NEW:** Fuzzy matching with "Did you mean" suggestions for misspelled names. Command aliases: `/readlog`, `/readlogs`, `/checklog`, `/checklogs` (logs) and `/readreport`, `/readreports`, `/checkreport`, `/checkreports` (reports).
- **Enhanced Privacy & Security** ‚Äî Message content redacted in all debug/info logs (shows `[X chars]` instead of full text). URL filter blocks adult and warez sites from crawling and search results with humorous error message. All sensitive user data gitignored.
- **Enhanced Dashboard** ‚Äî Real-time activity feed (20-line mobile-optimized view), radio configuration controls (node names, roles, modem presets, frequency slots), Ollama model management, collapsible command categories, and GitHub version selector. Accessible on mobile devices via `http://<your-ip>:5000/dashboard`.
- **Data Persistence** ‚Äî All user data (logs, reports, mail, settings, game states, relay preferences) now protected by `.gitignore` and persists across git updates and system reboots.
- **Mesh Mail** ‚Äî PIN-protected inboxes, multi-user notifications, and one-shot llama summaries keep longer messages flowing across the mesh.
- **Game Hub** ‚Äî Chess & Checkers duels, Blackjack, Yahtzee rounds, Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Wordle, Word Ladder, Adventure stories, Cipher drills, Bingo, Morse, Rock‚ÄìPaper‚ÄìScissors, Coinflip, Quiz Battle, **Mesh Master Quiz** (`/masterquiz` - 50 comprehensive questions), **Meshtastic Quiz** (`/meshtasticquiz` - 50 detailed questions), and more‚Äîall DM-friendly and multilingual.
- **Adaptive Personalities & Context Capsules** ‚Äî `/aipersonality` and `/save`/`/recall` tune the assistant instantly while persistent archives keep continuity across restarts.
- **Offline Knowledge on Tap** ‚Äî Trimmed MeshTastic handbook, offline wiki lookups, and cached expert answers deliver verified guidance without leaving the mesh.
- **Simplified Activity Logs** ‚Äî Icon-based notifications (üì® incoming, üìñ Bible, üéÆ Game, ü§ñ AI, etc.) with no message content or node names for privacy and reduced clutter.

## Feature Overview

### Network Bridge Relay System
MESH MASTER 2.0 can act as a relay bridge between multiple mesh networks, enabling communication across network boundaries.

**How It Works:**
- Send messages to any node by shortname: `snmo hello there` or `/snmo hello there`
- Real-time ACK tracking with 20-second timeout
- Confirmation shows which node acknowledged: `‚úÖ ACK by NodeName` or `‚ùå No ACK from NodeName`
- Multi-chunk support automatically handles long messages (tracks ACKs for all chunks)
- Queue-based architecture handles relay bursts safely (3 concurrent workers, 100-item queue)
- **Offline message queue:** Failed relays automatically stored and delivered when recipient comes online (max 10 messages per user, 24-hour expiry, 3 delivery attempts)
- **Privacy controls:** `/optout` to disable receiving relays, `/optin` to re-enable (preferences persist in `data/relay_optout.json`)

**Cross-Network Bridge:**
If MESH MASTER is connected to multiple networks (e.g., SnailNet + MainChannel), it acts as a bridge:
- Users on SnailNet can relay to users on MainChannel and vice versa
- `/nodes` command shows all reachable nodes across all networks
- Seamless multi-network communication without manual routing

**Example Use Case:**
```
Network A: Alice, Bob, MESH-MASTER
Network B: Charlie, MESH-MASTER

Alice (on Network A): "charlie how's the weather?"
MESH-MASTER relays across network boundary
Charlie receives message, ACKs back
Alice gets: "‚úÖ ACK by Charlie"
```

### AI Assistant Features
- End-to-end message history survives restarts (`messages_archive.json`) with configurable limits.
- Background async workers keep RX/TX responsive while Ollama generates replies.
- Tone and personalities can be adjusted at runtime with `/vibe`; the core system prompt is fixed. MOTD can be updated via DM-only admin commands.

### Mesh Mail & Collaboration
- Direct-message `/m mailbox message` to drop mail; guided flow creates boxes, sets optional PINs, and captures owner metadata.  
- `/c mailbox [question]` shows the latest entries and, when a question is provided, uses the bundled `llama3.2:1b` model to pull a concise answer.  
- `/wipe mailbox`, `/wipe chathistory`, `/wipe personality`, and `/wipe all <mailbox>` keep things tidy.  
- Notification engine flags subscribers on heartbeat with unread counts while respecting PIN security and brute-force throttling.  
- See `docs/mail_readme.md` for deep-dive internals.

### Game Hub & Morale Tools
- `/games` lists every title with quick descriptions and command hints.
- Story-driven `/adventure` adapts to the chat language and offers branching outcomes.
- `/wordladder` teammates can collaboratively bridge start/end words, asking the llama for hints on demand.
- Manage risk in `/blackjack`, push streaks in `/yahtzee`, or rally the squad with `/games` for the full list.
- Fast laughs with `/rps`, `/coinflip`, and `/quizbattle`; puzzle practice with `/cipher`, `/morse`, `/hangman`, `/wordle`.
- **Comprehensive Quiz Games:**
  - `/masterquiz` ‚Äî 50 questions covering all Mesh Master features (relay, logs, reports, commands, mail, offline queue, dashboard, wiki, games)
  - `/meshtasticquiz` ‚Äî 50 questions about Meshtastic (LoRa, mesh networking, node roles, SNR, presets, security, best practices)
  - Answer with 1-4 or a-d, check score anytime, auto-shuffled questions for replay value

### Knowledge & Research Aids
- `/meshtastic <question>` consults a curated ~25k token field guide with a warm cache for instant follow-ups.
- `/offline wiki <topic>` or `/offline wiki <topic> PIN=1234` taps locally mirrored reference articles.
- `/save` captures conversation context capsules for later `/recall`‚Äîperfect for mission hand-offs.
- `/find <query>` searches across private logs, public reports, wiki entries, and web crawl data with fuzzy matching.
- **URL Content Filter:** `/web` commands automatically block adult and warez sites from crawling and search results.
- **Fuzzy Search:** When log/report names are misspelled, get "Did you mean?" suggestions with top 3 matches.

### Web Dashboard & APIs
- Real-time log viewer with emoji categories (üì° connection, üì® messages, ü§ñ AI, ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings, üîß admin).  
- Three-column mesh console surfaces broadcasts, direct messages, and nearby nodes; quick-send form handles DM routing and chunking.  
- Health endpoints: `GET /ready`, `/live`, `/healthz`, `/heartbeat`, plus `/dashboard` and `/logs` frontends.  
- `/send` and `/ui_send` POST endpoints enable automated workflows; optional `/discord_webhook` bridge for cross-platform relays.

### Telegram Integration
MESH MASTER 2.0 includes full Telegram bot integration for remote mesh control and monitoring.

**Features:**
- **Remote Command Control** ‚Äî Send any mesh command from Telegram (same permissions as dashboard)
- **Real-time Notifications** ‚Äî Receive relay ACK confirmations, system alerts, and activity updates
- **Secure Access Control** ‚Äî Whitelist specific Telegram chat IDs for authorized control

---

### Security & Privacy Features

MESH MASTER 2.0 includes comprehensive security enhancements to protect sensitive data:

#### Message Content Redaction
All message content is automatically redacted in logs to protect privacy:
- **Debug/info logs** show `[X chars]` instead of full message text
- **File logs** (`mesh-master.log`) never contain message content
- **Dashboard activity feed** shows icons and metadata, not content
- **Console output** protects user privacy while maintaining debugging capabilities

Example log output:
```
ü§ñ [AsyncAI] Queueing response for Node_abc: [47 chars]
üì° Relay to snmo: [23 chars]
```

#### PIN Protection & Encryption
Mesh Mail system includes robust PIN security:
- **Hashed PINs** ‚Äî Stored as bcrypt hashes, never plain text
- **Brute-force throttling** ‚Äî Exponential backoff after failed attempts
- **Encryption keys** ‚Äî Auto-generated per mailbox for content encryption
- **Owner verification** ‚Äî Only mailbox owners can change PINs
- **Secure storage** ‚Äî `data/mail_security.json` is gitignored and local-only

#### URL Content Filtering
Web search and crawl commands block inappropriate content:
- **Adult content filter** ‚Äî Blocks adult/NSFW sites from `/web` results
- **Warez filter** ‚Äî Prevents piracy/illegal download sites
- **Humorous error messages** ‚Äî User-friendly blocked content notifications
- **Whitelist override** ‚Äî Admins can configure exceptions if needed

#### Data Gitignoring
All sensitive user data is automatically excluded from git:
- `data/mail_security.json` ‚Äî Mailbox PINs and encryption keys
- `data/logs/` ‚Äî Private user log entries
- `data/relay_optout.json` ‚Äî User privacy preferences
- `data/onboarding_state.json` ‚Äî User onboarding progress
- `*.log` files ‚Äî All runtime logs
- `messages_archive.json` ‚Äî Message history
- `mesh_mail.db` ‚Äî Mail database

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Safe git updates without losing user data
- ‚úÖ No accidental commits of sensitive information
- ‚úÖ Privacy preservation across code changes
- ‚úÖ Secure multi-user deployments

---

### Relay System (Network Bridge)

The relay system enables cross-network message delivery using shortnames.

#### How It Works

**Basic Usage:**
```
snmo hello there
/snmo hello there
```
Both send "hello there" to the node with shortname "snmo"

**Architecture:**
- **Shortname Cache** ‚Äî Thread-safe lookup table (shortname ‚Üí node_id)
- **Queue-Based Processing** ‚Äî 3 worker threads, 100-item queue capacity
- **Multi-Chunk Support** ‚Äî Long messages automatically split (160 chars/chunk)
- **ACK Tracking** ‚Äî 20-second timeout per chunk, real-time confirmation
- **Cross-Network Bridge** ‚Äî If Mesh Master sees networks A & B, users on A can relay to users on B

**ACK Confirmation:**
```
‚úÖ ACK by NodeName ‚Äî Message delivered successfully
‚ùå No ACK from NodeName ‚Äî Delivery failed (node offline or out of range)
```

**Offline Message Queue:**
When a relay fails (recipient offline), messages are automatically queued:
- **Storage:** Up to 10 messages per user
- **Expiry:** 24 hours from queue time
- **Retry:** 3 delivery attempts when recipient comes online
- **Notification:** Recipient gets all queued messages when they reconnect

**Privacy Controls:**
```
/optout  ‚Äî Disable receiving relays (others can't relay to the user)
/optin   ‚Äî Re-enable receiving relays
```
Preferences persist in `data/relay_optout.json` across reboots.

**Use Cases:**
- Send messages to specific nodes across different channels
- Bridge isolated mesh networks (e.g., hikers on trail + base camp)
- Coordinate team communications without channel flooding
- Store-and-forward for intermittent nodes

**Technical Details:**
- Relay requests processed asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Concurrent relay handling with thread-safe state management
- Per-chunk ACK tracking for reliable multi-chunk delivery
- Automatic shortname cache updates from node database
- Graceful degradation when recipient node is unreachable

#### Commands

**Sending Mail:**
```bash
/m mailbox message          # Send to mailbox
/mail recipient message     # Direct mail command
```

**Reading Mail:**
```bash
/c                          # Check all subscribed mailboxes
                            # Response: "You have 3 messages in 'ops' mailbox. (1 unread)"

/c supplies                 # Check specific mailbox
                            # Response: "You have 5 messages in 'supplies' mailbox. (3 unread)"

/c ops briefing             # Search for "briefing" in ops mailbox
                            # Shows up to 5 matching messages
```

**Management:**
```bash
/emailhelp                  # Show mail system help
/wipe mailbox name          # Delete a mailbox (owner only)
/wipe chathistory           # Clear AI chat history
/wipe personality           # Reset AI personality
/wipe all mailbox           # Wipe mailbox and all data
```

#### Mailbox Creation Flow

1. User sends `/m newbox first message`
2. System detects new mailbox, prompts for owner confirmation
3. User confirms, optionally sets PIN
4. Mailbox created with encryption
5. Subscribers auto-added (sender = first subscriber)

#### Notification System

**Heartbeat-Driven:**
- Checks for unread mail every ~30 seconds (heartbeat interval)
- Sends notifications to subscribers with unread counts
- Respects quiet hours and reminder frequency settings

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mail_notify_enabled": true,
  "mail_notify_reminders_enabled": true,
  "mail_notify_reminder_hours": 1.0,
  "mail_notify_max_reminders": 3,

  "mail_quiet_start_hour": 20,
  "mail_quiet_end_hour": 8,
  "mail_notify_include_self": false,
  "mail_notify_heartbeat_only": true
}
```

**Reminder Logic:**
- First notification: Immediate when mail arrives
- Reminders: Every N hours (default: 1 hour) up to max reminders (default: 3)
- Quiet hours: No notifications between 20:00-08:00 (configurable)
- Include self: Whether sender gets their own mail notifications

#### Security Features

**PIN Protection:**
- PINs hashed with bcrypt (never stored plain text)
- Exponential backoff on failed attempts: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s...
- Max attempts tracked per user
- Lockout after too many failed attempts

**Encryption:**
- Auto-generated encryption keys per mailbox
- Content encrypted at rest
- Keys stored in `data/mail_security.json` (gitignored)

**Access Control:**
- Owner verification for destructive operations
- Subscriber management (owner can add/remove)
- PIN required for viewing protected mailboxes

#### Storage

**Database:** `mesh_mail.db` (SQLite)
- Messages table with timestamps, sender, content
- Efficient querying for recent messages
- Automatic cleanup of old messages (configurable)

**Security File:** `data/mail_security.json`
```json
{
  "mailbox_name": {
    "owner": "node_id",
    "pin_hash": "bcrypt_hash",
    "encryption_key": "base64_key",
    "subscribers": {
      "node_id": {
        "last_read_ts": 1234567890,
        "unread_count": 3,
        "last_notification_ts": 1234567800,
        "notification_count": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Cases

/m ops Updated weather forecast: rain expected
/c ops briefing
  ‚Üí Shows messages containing "briefing" in ops mailbox
```

**Information Sharing:**
```
/m intel Saw 3 hikers at waypoint B, heading north
/m supplies Need more batteries, low on channel 2
/c supplies batteries
  ‚Üí Shows messages containing "batteries" in supplies mailbox
```

**Long-Form Messages:**
```
/m journal Today we reached the summit after 6 hours...
/m notes Remember to check radio settings before departure
/c notes
  ‚Üí Shows all messages in notes mailbox
```

**Collaborative Planning:**
```
/m planning Route A blocked, suggest Route B via creek
/c planning route
  ‚Üí Shows messages containing "route" in planning mailbox
```

#### Search Example

```
User: /c ops
Bot: You have 5 messages in 'ops' mailbox. (3 unread)

User: /c ops briefing
Bot: üîç Matches in 'ops' (newest first)
     1) 2025-10-09 14:30 Alice: Mission briefing at 0600 tomorrow
     2) 2025-10-08 09:15 Bob: Updated briefing materials attached

User: /c ops weather
Bot: üîç Matches in 'ops' (newest first)
     1) 2025-10-09 15:00 Alice: Updated weather forecast: rain expected
```

The search performs keyword matching across message content and sender names (configurable `mail_search_max_messages`).

- Note the IP address

#### Step 6: Configure

Edit `config.json` in Notepad or your favorite editor:

Windows serial example:
```json
{
  "serial_port": "COM3",
  "serial_baud": 38400,
  "use_wifi": false,
  "ollama_model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "ollama_url": "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
}
```

Windows WiFi example:
```json
{
  "use_wifi": true,
  "wifi_host": "192.168.1.XXX",
  "wifi_port": 4403,
  "ollama_model": "llama3.2:1b"
}
```

#### Step 7: Run Mesh Master

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Run Mesh Master
python mesh-master.py

# Access dashboard at: http://localhost:5000/dashboard
```

#### Step 8: Run at Startup (Optional)

**Option 1: Task Scheduler**
1. Open Task Scheduler (search in Start menu)
2. Click "Create Basic Task"
3. Name: "Mesh Master"
4. Trigger: "When I log on"
5. Action: "Start a program"
6. Program: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Mesh-Master\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
7. Arguments: `mesh-master.py`
8. Start in: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Mesh-Master`
9. Finish and enable

**Option 2: Startup Folder (Simple)**
1. Create a batch file `start-mesh-master.bat`:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   cd /d C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Mesh-Master
   call .venv\Scripts\activate
   python mesh-master.py
   ```
2. Press Win+R, type `shell:startup`
3. Create shortcut to the batch file in this folder

## Post-Installation Steps (All Platforms)

### 1. Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and go to:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
- **From another device:** `http://YOUR_IP:5000/dashboard`

### 2. Test Basic Commands

Send a direct message to your node via Meshtastic app:
```
/menu
```

You should receive the main menu response.

### 3. Configure AI Model (Optional)

If using a different model:
```bash
# List available models
ollama list

# Pull a different model
ollama pull wizard-math:7b
```

Update `ollama_model` in config.json and restart.

### 4. Explore Features

Try these commands in a DM to your node:
- `/onboard` - Interactive tutorial
- `/help` - Command reference
- `/ai Explain how LoRa works` - Test AI
- `/games` - See available games
- `/nodes` - List mesh nodes

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Could not connect to serial port"**
- Check USB cable is connected
- Verify correct serial port in config.json
- On Linux/Mac: Check user has dialout/uucp group access
- On Windows: Check Device Manager for correct COM port

**"Connection timeout"**
- For WiFi: Verify device IP address is correct
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 4403 (WiFi) or 5000 (dashboard)
- Try rebooting the Meshtastic device

### Ollama/AI Issues

**"Connection refused to Ollama"**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Start Ollama
# Linux/Mac: ollama serve
# Windows: Should start automatically, check Task Manager
```

**AI responses are slow**
- Use smaller models on Raspberry Pi: `llama3.2:1b`
- Reduce `ollama_context_chars` in config.json
- Increase `ollama_timeout` to 180 seconds

### Dashboard Not Loading

1. Check Mesh Master is running: Look for "Starting MESH-MASTER server..."
2. Try: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard`
3. Check firewall allows port 5000
4. View raw logs: `http://localhost:5000/logs/raw`

### Permission Denied (Linux/Mac)

```bash
# Add user to dialout group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# On Mac, try:
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $USER -t user _uucp

# Reboot for changes to take effect
```

### Module Import Errors

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

## Container Workflow

Build the 2.0 image locally so you run the exact code in this repository:

```bash
docker build -t mesh-master:2.0 .
```

Minimal compose example:

```yaml
services:
  mesh-master:
    image: mesh-master:2.0
    container_name: mesh-master
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
      - ./commands_config.json:/app/commands_config.json:ro
      - ./motd.json:/app/motd.json:ro
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./state/mesh-master.log:/app/mesh-master.log
      - ./state/messages.log:/app/messages.log
      - ./state/messages_archive.json:/app/messages_archive.json
      - ./state/script.log:/app/script.log
      - ./state/mesh_mailboxes.json:/app/mesh_mailboxes.json
      - ./state/mesh_mail.db:/app/mesh_mail.db
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If you rely on USB serial, also bind `/dev/serial/by-id` (read-only) and `/dev` as needed, and set `MESH_INTERFACE`/`serial_port` accordingly.

Create the `state` directory (and `touch` the files listed above) before the first run so Docker can mount them successfully.
