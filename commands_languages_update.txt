Commands & Language Update Notes
================================

Overview
--------
- Introduced a structured `/menu` flow with bilingual (English/Spanish) sections and submenu prompts.
- Created `/mud`, a persistent choose-your-own-adventure cavalry campaign set around 1850s El Paso, available in English and Spanish.
- Expanded command aliases so English and Spanish shortcuts (e.g., `/bromas`, `/aventura`) route to the new menus.
- Added a `language_selection` option in `config.json` to switch default menus and helper text between English and Spanish.
- Normalised translation helpers so unspecified locales now respect the configured default language.

Menu & Command Changes
----------------------
- `/mud` command launches or advances the El Paso cavalry adventure; `/mud start`, `/mud <number>`, `/mud status`, and `/mud restart` manage the narrative flow.
- Extended alias coverage so `/joke`, `/funnies`, `/mudgame`, `/cavalry`, `/adventure`, and their Spanish counterparts (`/bromas`, `/chistes`, `/aventura`, `/caballeria`, `/juego`, etc.) properly resolve.
- Introduced trivia commands `/bibletrivia`, `/disastertrivia`, and `/trivia` with English/Spanish aliases plus a persistent scoreboard for each category.

Cavalry Adventure Details
-------------------------
- Storyline includes multiple entry points (Fort Bliss muster, Rio Grande patrol, Franklin Mountain recon) for replay value.
- Choices influence gold and integrity meters; endings summarise moral outcomes to reinforce the redemption arc.
- Game state (scene, history, stats) now persists per user and channel in `cavalry_game_states.json`, allowing long-running sessions.
- Messages, prompts, and outcome summaries adapt to the configured default language, with Spanish translations for all narrative text.

Internationalisation Updates
----------------------------
- New helper `_normalize_language_code` centralises mapping of "english"/"spanish" selections to `en`/`es` codes.
- `language_selection` in `config.json` defaults to `english`; set to `spanish` to switch menu defaults. (Example: "language_selection": "spanish")
- Translation utilities (`translate`, `get_language_strings`, `_preferred_menu_language`) now defer to the configured fallback when no language hint is present.

Files Touched
-------------
- `mesh-master.py`
  * Implemented the cavalry adventure state machine, persistence, and command wiring.
  * Normalised language handling with config-driven defaults.
- `config.json`
  * Added `language_selection` setting (default `english`).
- `commands_languages_update.txt`
  * This summary file for repository documentation.

Operational Notes
-----------------
- After changing `language_selection`, restart the application to reload the new default language.
- `cavalry_game_states.json` can be removed to clear all saved adventure progress.
- Global chunk pacing now defaults to a 4-second buffer between outgoing message chunks; adjust `chunk_buffer_seconds` in `config.json` if you need a different rate.
- Chuck Norris, blond, and yo momma joke pools have been scrubbed for PG-13 friendliness (no explicit language or suggestive content remains).
- Ack retry tracking has been rolled back so messages send without enforced acknowledgements, preventing radio timeouts seen during stress tests.
