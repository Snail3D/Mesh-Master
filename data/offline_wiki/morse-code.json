  "content": "Morse code is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of several developers of the code system. Morse's preliminary proposal for a telegraph code was replaced by an alphabet-based code developed by Alfred Vail, the engineer working with Morse; it was Vail's version that was used for commercial telegraphy in North America. Friedrich Gerke was another substantial developer; he simplified Vail's code to produce the code adopted in Europe, and most of the alphabetic part of the current international (ITU) \"Morse\" is copied from Gerke's revision.\nThe ITU International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters A to Z, one accented Latin letter (É), the Indo-Arabic numerals 0 to 9, and a small set of punctuation and messaging procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message, once the rhythm is established, a half-beat is the basic...",
